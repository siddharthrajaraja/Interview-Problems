<a href='https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/delete-without-head-pointer/1'>Link to problem</a>
<br>
This at first sight seems to be vague but this problem has a fine Intution inside !! <br>
<strong>Intution:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Think of a O(n) solution.</li>
    <li>Try to play with data by copying the next node data to current one.</li>
    <li>End up deleting the end node of list.</li>
    <li>Corner case: What about a single node ?</li>
</ol>
