# Bits '1s' or '0s' ?

### Reverse Bits 💯 : 

#### Link to problem : [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/) or [Interview Bit](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

#### Intution 👍:

    1. Think of a container that helps you reverse a list of values .
    2. What kind of values can this container have ? (HINT : 0s and 1s)
    3. How are you going to get the set or unset values out of the input unsigned integer provided ? Can you get the bits optimally? (Hint: Bit manipulation).
    4. Reverse the container and try to obtain the result by applying reverse Engineering . 😄 😸
