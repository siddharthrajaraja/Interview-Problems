#### Longest Consecutive Sequence

###### Link to problem üëç [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

##### Intution:
    1. Try to minimize the array-size by removing similar elements and sort the given array.
    2. Can you index the elements present in the set to directly refer them anyhow?
    3. Hash and maintain a flag to check which element exists (a typical intution of Counting Sort Algorithm) or simply iterate that set to form a new vector.
    4. Initialize maxii (maximum consecutive counter) to INT_MIN to get the maximum consecutive size of Longest Consecutive Sequence.
    4. For every index in the array/vector (1:vector.size()) check whether the previous element is predecessor or not .
    4. If "YES" : increment the counter.
    5. Otherwise reinitialize value of maxii to counter and reinitialize counter to 1.
    6. Return maxii (maximum consecutive counter).
