            <li>Try Finding out LCS string.
            <li>With the obtained LCS try integrating the non LCS character in such a way that they occur in the same order of their appearance in their desired strings.
            <li>The solution string is union of LCS and non LCS characters in order of their apprearance.

    <ol>
            <li>Try to figure out O(n*n) Logic with a hint of storing the common difference between each pair of elements when iterated. 
            <li>Try to build a Hash Map dynamically from index (1:size of array) in such a way that Hash Map stores the elements of type {key(common difference):value(counter)} which is referenced for each pair from previously iterated index.
            <li>Try to find out the max counter present in the Hash Map . The (max+1) will give you solution . Guess why?
            <li>Pairing elements helps you find the solution reason for adding 1 behind max is the same you need to count elements that are paired together. 
    </ol>
